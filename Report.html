<BR>
<P>Thank you for using the 4Pipe4
analysis pipeline. In this file you will find links to each of the
results files generated by 4Pipe4. These are divided in several
categories. Keep in mind that some of them might be missing if you
specifically excluded some modules from running when you executed
4Pipe4 (in which case you should know which ones to look for).</P>
<P><A HREF="Metrics.html">Click here</A> to see the <B>metrics
report</B>. Here yo will find a short report on your dataset's
metrics, with information such as average read length (before and
after seqclean), number of SNPs found, etc. It is particularly useful
to use as a summary for a publication.</P>
<P><A HREF="SNPs.html">Click here</A> to see the <B>SNP
discovery results</B>. This report is presented as a table for your
convenience. The table itself is pretty self explanatory, but in it
you can find information such as the contigs where each SNP was
found, the SNP characterization and the BLAST best hit result. This
blast best hit will in turn link you to the full BLAST report where
you can find information such as e-values, other hits, etc...</P>
<P><A HREF="SSRs.html">Click here</A> to see the <B>SSR
discovery results</B>. This report contains the SSRs found in the
assembly which have an average quality of at least the value defined
in 4Piep4rc.</P>
<P>Remember that all the tables can be
simply copied &amp; pasted into any spreadsheet software (useful for
sorting, etc...).</P>
<P>Found a bug? Have a suggestion?
Just want to say hello? Just <A href="mailto:f.pinamartins@gmail.com?Subject=4Pipe4">contact the author</A>, I'll be happy to get any feedback.</P>
